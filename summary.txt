Today I had the opportunity to watch all of the graduating g(10) cohort present their capstone projects on hiring day. I got an opportunity to see into my future a bit and know a little about what I was working toward. After the presentations we broke for lunch and enjoyed some delicious food. After lunch we learned CSS fundamentals and I saw live coding for the first time. That was exciting. It was great to see live coding because it added an element to the learning style. While Roberto was teaching the subject matter if there was a question on what he meant or how to do what he was saying to do we could say “show me how” and he could demonstrate how to do it and what it looks like when its done. To test our CSS we attempted to create a webpage that looked like a mock up.
struggle_of_the_day : Something I struggled with today was positioning of elements in CSS. I have always struggled with this. 
solution_of_the_day : The solution that really put into perspective was Roberto taught me to think of the elements as columns and rows. This made organizing the elements in my head easier and allowed me to navigate between elements much better.
