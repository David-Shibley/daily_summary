Today I had the opportunity to watch all of the graduating g(10) cohort present their capstone projects on hiring day. I got an opportunity to see into my future a bit and know a little about what I was working toward. After the presentations we broke for lunch and enjoyed some delicious food. After lunch we learned CSS fundamentals and I saw live coding for the first time. That was exciting. It was great to see live coding because it added an element to the learning style. While Roberto was teaching the subject matter if there was a question on what he meant or how to do what he was saying to do we could say “show me how” and he could demonstrate how to do it and what it looks like when its done. To test our CSS we attempted to create a webpage that looked like a mock up.
struggle_of_the_day : Something I struggled with today was positioning of elements in CSS. I have always struggled with this. 
solution_of_the_day : The solution that really put into perspective was Roberto taught me to think of the elements as columns and rows. This made organizing the elements in my head easier and allowed me to navigate between elements much better.

Today we had a guest speaker named Drew Dalman that works for a small company that makes some really cool things. This guy was brilliant! He makes awesome things during his time at work and in his off time manages to create this super awesome applications that he considers just side projects. All of which are quality enough ideas to be main projects. I would love to be a point in my career where I could maintain a position as a senior developer and still have time to create such awesome projects that give back to the community and are so impactful. We also saw a demonstration of lightning talks and learned a lot of relatively useless information. It was informative though because it allowed the opportunity to see first hand the environment structure that we will one day be a part of. We also had a breakout group lead by Alex and Eric that was on the relationship between UX (the overall User eXperience) and the UI (the user interface). The basics would suggest that UI is more the look and the UX is more the feel. There appaears to be a major overlap in many different aspects of that relationship and producing an absolute definition of one or the other is quite difficult.
